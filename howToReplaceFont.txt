How to replace the font:

1. Download the swf with replaceable font ( regular version links to gfxfontlib.swf to automatically report generic font replacers )
2. Download & Install FFDEC https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version15.0.0
3. Right click on the downloaded swf and "Open with FFDEC"
4. Select the fonts section on the left, then in the bottom right select Embed.
5. In the new Font Embedding window, select All Characters (or less if it's a huge font I guess, uppercase and lowercase are technically good enough for this file.)
6. Select OK, then select Yes to all.
7. When prompted to updated texts, select yes.
8. Hit the save button in the top left hand corner.
9. Load in game and you should have your updated swf file, congrats :)
